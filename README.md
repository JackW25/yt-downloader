if you have an issue with it, please open an issue, if you have any suggestions feel free to open a pull request

I do not add certain things to the website upon request, but if they are reasonable and/or highly suggested I will try and add them to the main website

# What is this?

This is a side project I have made to learn HTML/CSS. It uses NodeJS and YTDL-CORE to convert a youtube link into a variety of different Audio/Video Formats

**Note:** Github Pages does *not* work, please use the herokuapp link above

# Self Hosting

This repo is already set for self hosting, simply install
NodeJS: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

In the main directory, run the command:
node index.js

this should come up with a message saying the website is bound to port *3000*
in a webpage, go to **localhost:3000**, ***this will NOT WORK on other devices that ARE NOT THE ONE YOU ARE HOSTING ON***

the webpage will work as normal
